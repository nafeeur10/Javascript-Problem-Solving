Problem: 
A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 with exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 2. In contrast, 4 is not prime since it is divisible by 1, 2 and 4.

Rewrite sumPrimes so it returns the sum of all prime numbers that are less than or equal to num.

Solution:

function sumPrimes(num) {
  
  let sum = 0;

  for(let i = 2; i <=num; i++)
  {

     let bool = 0;

     for(let j = 2; j < i; j++)
     {
       if(i%j == 0)
       {
         bool = 1;
         break;
       }
     }

     if(bool == 0)
     {
       sum+=i;
     }
  }

  return sum;
}

sumPrimes(10);
